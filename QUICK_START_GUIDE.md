## Common Questions

### Q: Why do I need to configure credentials?
A: Your credentials are used to access your OpenAI API and Supabase database. They're never stored on our servers.

A: You can upload up to 5 documents at a time. Each document can be up to 50MB.

### Q: What file formats are supported?
A: PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV, JSON, and Markdown files are supported.

### Q: How does the chat work?
A: The chat uses semantic search to find relevant documents based on your question, then displays the most relevant excerpts.

### Q: What does the similarity score mean?
A: The similarity score (0-100%) indicates how closely the document matches your query. Higher scores mean more relevant.

### Q: Can I save my chat history?
A: Currently, chat history is stored during your session. Refresh the page to start a new conversation.

### Q: What if I get an error?
A: Check that your credentials are correct and your documents have been uploaded. The error message will provide more details.

### Q: How many documents will be returned?
A: Up to 5 most relevant documents will be returned for each query.

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Interface Not Showing
- **Solution**: Make sure you've configured your credentials first

### "No relevant documents found"
- **Solution**: Try rephrasing your question or check if documents are uploaded

### Error: "Invalid credentials"
- **Solution**: Verify your OpenAI API key and Supabase credentials are correct

### Slow responses
- **Solution**: This is normal for large documents. Processing may take a few seconds.

### Messages not sending
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and make sure credentials are configured

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Be Specific**: More specific questions get better results
2. **Use Keywords**: Include key terms from your documents
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous questions for context
4. **Check Sources**: Review the sources to verify accuracy
5. **Rephrase**: If results aren't helpful, try asking differently
